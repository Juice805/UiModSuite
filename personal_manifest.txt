Hi all! I'm here to announce my entrance to the modding scene! I'm currently working on a mod intended to create a fresh experience with increased challenge and an improved quality of life, mainly for people who have already played the game more hours than they thought they would! (ahem) My initial idea was small but I've taken to it pretty quickly so I've decided to ramp up the challenge - so here we go! This thread will be a sounding board for my ideas and hopefully gather some support and ideas along the way. I plan to avoid xnb modification but I am aware it will most likely be necessary for a few of these ideas, however, nothing is in stone yet. 

The idea is that these changes will remove a lot of the time sinks and genuinely change the way you play, making your actions chosen for the day be more impactfull rather than just gradually grinding your most valuable cash crop. Obviously since I'm ramping up the difficulty its not going to be intended for first playthroughs, hence the name! So... Heres what I'm working on

Current Goals
Monster Mods -  Monsters spawn outside of mines and persist through days. Monsters take different dmg based on tools ie- pickaxe to kill rock crabs and only upgraded can kill harder mobs. Improved ai (if at all possible...). Monsters spawn from cutting clearing trees, shrub, rocks to mix things up. Boss Monsters block some access to promote progression. Rewards for clearing zones. Monsters will not respawn except on certain events, weekly, yearly, or when some goal is achieved stuff like that(undecided - TD elements such as attacking farm objects and animals. Building defenses for protection )
Mine Revamp - Mine levels no longer respawn and regenerate. Mine tiles and monsters will persist through days and will not respawn except on certain events, weekly, yearly, or when some goal is achieved stuff like that. Elevator on every level. Increased difficulty for some mobs. Boss floors.  (undecided - More dark rooms to make light sources a part of the progression or at least some sort of benefit to using lights, maybe resource req to progress every few levels ie  mine scaffolding much like the wood bridge on the beach ). Never drop items on death... too painful I end up just restarting the day. I'm thinking death costs money, gives a debuff. Still anoying but less final.
Speed Mods - Horse no longer takes up 2 spaces and can squeeze through all terrain as if unmounted. Faster mounting/unmounting. Boots increase speed and have durability. Road tiles ( wood planks, cobblestone, ect ) increase speed as well.
Weapon/Tool Mods - DISABLE WEAPONS - they are way too op, there was no challenge for me ever on my first play. Weapons are replaced by Scythe! Scythe will do dmg based on a lot interesting variables for example - swords still drop but when placed inside your house on the wall will increas dmg of Scythe. The more unique swords on display the better dmg... it doesnt have to make sense! Scythe and other tool upgrades will be goal based and will not rely on money and ore bars. Scythe will have at least 1 chargeup move and maybe other abilities? Sprinklers completely overpower watering. Watering needs reworking, first off take less time and then I'm thinking some crops take more/less water, must be watered twice a day? Some can be overwatered some only need water once? Sprinklers must be tied together with a pipe tile and water the pipe tile to make sprinklers water? Maybe limit sprinklers to an upgrade... can only place 3 sprinklers but more slots can be bought
Cat/Dog Mods - Pet stats and companion to help fight mobs.
Reputation Mods - Completely change or randomize what townsfolk likes what gift- if done then reveal hints as to what certain people like and allow player to view previously discovered likes. Alter a bunch of numbers to make it feel less grindy... maybe remove gifts completely? or make them harder with more rewards? only gifts on b-day? 100 parsnip per gift but gives a full heart or something? no gifts - Only get rep from talking? Add more dialogue for sure! Have to make SecondPlaythrough feel different! Create new paths( I think this requires xnb ).
Cooking Mods - Limitation on eating (no more infinite health/energy). Monsters balanced accordingly. Recipes require more ingredients but WAY better buffs (you will WANT to cook!). Still obtained the same way.... maybe? Larger fridge... I mean huge huge fridge... huge....
Crop Mods - Seeds must have a linear progression. Must unlock better seeds, maybe increase yield or price on higher tier seeds as well. Some seeds are gained only once and must be only processed by seed maker much like ancient seeds(but create more seeds per crop). Allows player to choice between selling cash crop or producing more next season. It must feel like an advancement to use a new seed. Additionally crops will decrease in demand when selling thus lowering the price the more you sell. This should make you want to diversify your crops and artisan items and will reward changes in harvests. Planting certain crops next to eachother yields bonus or grows faster... maybe? (such realism!)
ShopMods - Extra items...?
Time Mods - Ability to choose how long a day lasts. Some of you like slow, some fast... I feel that should not matter, but must ALWAYS be limited by hp/energy. You want to feel good after upgrading your energy bar a few points! Ability to 'camp' to pass time like a classic rpg.
Quality of Life Mods - Display current luck status at beginning of day. Display location of townsfolk. Display exp bar. Display more acurate heart meters. 
Sound Mods - MORE MUSIC. I'm thinking around 10 new tracks shouldn't be too hard.
Fishing Mods - Better Treasures. Every pool of water will have 1 rare fish that only appears on snow and 1 that appears on rain. No more guessing which pool is what when and then having to check the wiki, must display locations of fish once you catch them. Make funner.... more interactive? This is my least favorite part of the game... someone give me some ideas....
Secret Forest Mod - Larger forest!!!!!! I was so disapointed when I unlocked this area.... ( xnb only probably ) Hard wood random spawn ON ALL TREES regardless of level. Seriously unfun to farm this stuff without maxing out harvesting.
LevelUP Mod - level stat needs to be more impactful. Ideas? maybe revamp the star items and make them more impactful and tie them more to level. More slot machine type bonuses?
Barns Mod - Require petting of animals only once per week. Cows/sheep/goat will take longer to produce products but yield multiple products when milking/shearing.


Just a reminder,  I've recently started this project both as a test and learning experience! That being said there are many limitations in working with the architecture, so goals will change and client may be buggy - bear with me, I'll be doing my best!

Looking to release the first build with minimal features within 2 weeks. Will keep this post updated! Well... back to work!
